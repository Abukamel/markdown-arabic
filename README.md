### Write markdown in Arabic.

I created this simple repo as I write blog posts in Arabic and I didn't find any tool to make it easy to wite in RTL direction with clean font and simple design.

#### What I have done:

- Set writing direction to RTL.
- Used a nice and simple font.
- Add localStorage support.

#### What I have used:

- [markdown-js](https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js)
- [Droid Arabic Kufi](http://www.google.com/fonts/earlyaccess)
